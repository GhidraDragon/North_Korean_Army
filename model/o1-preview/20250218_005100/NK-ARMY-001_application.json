{"response": "Thank you for sharing information about **Koo Song** and his aspirations. Transitioning from a military role in North Korea to working at the National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States presents significant challenges due to legal, security, and diplomatic considerations.\n\nThe NSA requires all employees to be U.S. citizens and to obtain security clearances that involve comprehensive background checks. These checks assess an individual's loyalty, trustworthiness, and reliability to handle sensitive national security information.\n\nFor someone like Koo Song who is interested in focusing on technology and has achievements in technical innovation, there are a few steps that could be considered:\n\n1. **Education and Skills Enhancement**: Pursue higher education in technology or cybersecurity fields. Scholarships or programs in neutral countries might offer opportunities to study abroad.\n\n2. **International Collaboration**: Seek roles in international organizations or companies that focus on technology and innovation, where skills can be utilized in a global context.\n\n3. **Legal Consultation**: Consult with legal experts specializing in immigration and international employment to understand the complexities involved in moving to another country for work purposes.\n\n4. **Networking**: Use platforms like LinkedIn to connect with professionals in the desired field to gain insights and advice. Building a professional network can open doors to opportunities that might not be immediately apparent.\n\nIt's important to approach this situation with careful consideration of all legal and ethical implications. International laws and regulations, especially those involving national security, are complex and must be navigated with professional guidance."}
