This process involves an extensive background check to ensure national security is not compromised.\n\n3. **Legal Considerations:** Employment cannot violate U.S. laws, including those related to national security and foreign affiliations.\n\n**Recommendations for Koo Song:**\n\n- **Explore International Opportunities:** There are numerous international organizations and companies focused on technology and security where his skills could be valuable.\n\n- **Further Education:** Pursuing advanced studies in technology or cybersecurity could open doors to new opportunities.\n\n- **Consult with Authorities:** Before making any decisions, it would be advisable for him to consult with appropriate officials or career advisors who understand the legal and diplomatic considerations involved.\n\n**Important Note:** Transitioning from a military position in one country to a sensitive government role in another, especially between nations with complex relationships, involves significant legal and diplomatic challenges.
